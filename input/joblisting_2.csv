On the off chance you've thought about insurance, it's likely because you've insured something you love, not because you loved your insurance company. Metromile is out to change that. As an insurtech company powered by data science and customer-centric design, we're building a community of drivers who come for the savings and stay for the experience.

With technology at its core, Metromile is reimagining insurance to make it fairer and actually delightful. We're obsessed with savings, service, and features -- street sweeping alerts, monthly mileage summaries, fuel trackers and more -- that engage a customer all along their journey. We're on the forefront of disrupting a $250 billion auto insurance category that has gone unchanged for over 80 years.

Metromile's diverse team combines the best of Silicon Valley technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial services giants. This management structure ensures that the business is focused on growth, customer experience and technology innovation while also balancing unit economics and profitability. The team is growing quickly across its San Francisco, Tempe, and Boston offices, as well as remotely. Our customer service, claims, and sales teams are all based in-house in the US.

A few recent ones include: named a Benzinga ""Best Insurtech"" finalist, a Top Company to Work For , one of the Healthiest Employers in Phoenix , and a Best Place to Work .

Your models will have an outsized impact in optimizing the balance between profitability, risk, and growth; enabling dynamic customer experiences; and powering our pricing strategies.

Data is our product; understanding how driver behavior relates to risk is at the core of our insurance business and will disrupt the way the industry currently operates. For one project, you might draw on data from in-car sensors, mobile devices, and connected vehicles to improve how quickly we are able to assess driving risk. For another, you might use the data we collect during the quote-and-enroll sign-up process to streamline the customer experience.

If you are excited by the opportunity to explore diverse data sources and work on impactful projects central to our company's mission, we'd love to hear from you.

ABOUT RAPP

Our purpose

We are the agency absolutely, utterly, fiercely focused on the individual. We use our data, technology and creative smarts to make meaningful, connections with every single person a brand knows.

As a guiding ethos, RAPP stands up for Individuality. So much as, that's in our agency value proposition. We're committed to racial justice, equality, representation, and unbiased economic opportunity, because we know that the strength of our diversity helps us create our best work. And we believe in harnessing the strength of all our Fiercely Individual people, and the differences among us, because that's the surest way to positively impact our business and network culture.

Our family

We are a member of Omnicom's Precision Marketing Group (OPMG) focused on digital and CRM marketing.

Our home

If we learned anything this year, it's that our organization truly can implement a ""work where you work best"" philosophy. We still have physical offices, and, if they're open, you are welcome to use them whenever you like. RAPP is located right near Chinatown in the financial district of San Francisco, we're used to trollies (and tourists) daily.

No pressure, though - if you aren't comfortable with coming in while COVID-19 plays out, you can still work where you work best. That said, while we do have our ""work where you work best"" philosophy, we legally have to care about what state you claim permanent residency in (it's a tax thing).

Our clients

From opening a checking account, helping to reduce peanut allergies, or diving into the creative tools that help engineers most, we provide smart solutions for Wells Fargo, Aimmune Therapeutics and Palo Alto Networks.

ABOUT YOU

You have 2-3 years of experience in a data science or data engineering role. A master's degree is preferred but not required. You have a strong knowledge of R/Python programming and database technologies like SQL/Redshift and ideally have some exposure to tools like Apache Spark and AWS Sagemaker.

We are thinking a lot about media mix modelling and multi-touch attribution these days but any experience you have integrating disparate data sets and applying machine learning algorithms to surface insights around consumer behavior or to create more precise and personalized marketing campaigns will get our attention.

PicnicHealth is all about making medical records easy to access and using data to power the next frontier of medical research. We work directly with patients to give them the only tool anywhere that truly provides all of their medical records from any doctor or healthcare system in the US—in an easy-to-use, secure online dashboard. Patients can then choose to contribute their unique data to scientific research, which helps researchers accelerate breakthroughs in care for the diseases they care about. To date we've helped tens of thousands of patients, partnered with some of the world's largest biopharma companies, and raised more than $35M including from Felicis Ventures, Amplify Partners, and Y Combinator. Post Series B, we're growing quickly in revenue, partnerships, and people - it's an exciting time to join the PicnicHealth team!

ML at Picnic

Machine learning is at the heart of our work. While the healthcare industry is waiting for standards and APIs to take hold, we're able to create meaningful medical data today through our process for extracting and structuring medical information from records in whatever format they exist in the real world. We ingest medical records (faxes, scans, etc of printouts from EHRs, electronic data from EHRs) and convert them into structured, labeled medical data. Think of what we do as a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop machine learning system. We 1) run OCR to transform the image into text, 2) identify and label regions of the record, and 3) classify medical concepts with codes from standard ontologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, etc) and structure relevant attributes. Ultimately, structuring data is just the starting point. We'll use machine learning to pull insights from medical data and surface the most relevant information to make better decisions around care.

We've sourced and trained a scalable team of nurses in the Philippines to identify and label data and have already labeled records from more than 25,000 different doctors. We're going through a crazy period of 20x growth this year, coming off our recent Grand Prize finish in Google Cloud's Machine Learning Startup Competition .

ML at Picnic

Machine learning is at the heart of our work. While the healthcare industry is waiting for standards and APIs to take hold, we're able to create meaningful medical data today through our process for extracting and structuring medical information from records in whatever format they exist in the real world. We ingest medical records (faxes, scans, etc of printouts from EHRs, electronic data from EHRs) and convert them into structured, labeled medical data. Think of what we do as a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop machine learning system. We 1) run OCR to transform the image into text, 2) identify and label regions of the record, and 3) classify medical concepts with codes from standard ontologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, etc) and structure relevant attributes. Ultimately, structuring data is just the starting point. We'll use machine learning to pull insights from medical data and surface the most relevant information to make better decisions around care.

We've sourced and trained a scalable team of nurses in the Philippines to identify and label data and have already labeled records from more than 25,000 different doctors. We're going through a crazy period of 20x growth this year, coming off our recent Grand Prize finish in Google Cloud's Machine Learning Startup Competition .

ML at Picnic

Machine learning is at the heart of our work. While the healthcare industry is waiting for standards and APIs to take hold, we're able to create meaningful medical data today through our process for extracting and structuring medical information from records in whatever format they exist in the real world. We ingest medical records (faxes, scans, etc of printouts from EHRs, electronic data from EHRs) and convert them into structured, labeled medical data. Think of what we do as a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop machine learning system. We 1) run OCR to transform the image into text, 2) identify and label regions of the record, and 3) classify medical concepts with codes from standard ontologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, etc) and structure relevant attributes. Ultimately, structuring data is just the starting point. We'll use machine learning to pull insights from medical data and surface the most relevant information to make better decisions around care.

We've sourced and trained a scalable team of nurses in the Philippines to identify and label data and have already labeled records from more than 25,000 different doctors. We're going through a crazy period of 20x growth this year, coming off our recent Grand Prize finish in Google Cloud's Machine Learning Startup Competition .

The mission of Earli is large and ambitious: make cancer a benign experience.

Earli is developing a new orthogonal approach for early cancer detection and localization, making the disease actionable a stage when the chances of survival are significantly higher. Rather than rely on naturally shed biomarkers that cancer may or may not provide, Earli's platform technology usurps the dysregulated pathways that cause malignancy and *forces* cancer cells to make a synthetic, non-human biomarker using gene therapy approaches. It's called a Synthetic Biopsy . It can then localize the cancer in a PET scanner, and even be extended to therapeutics. Developed initially by the late Sam Gambhir , former head of Stanford's Canary Center for Early Cancer Detection, and co-founded by serial entrepreneur Cyriac Roeding and gene therapy veteran David Suhy , Earli is funded by Andreessen Horowitz's Bio Fund, Khosla Ventures, Perceptive Advisors, Casdin Capital, Sands Capital, Marc Benioff, Menlo Ventures and ZhenFund. Earli is based in the West Coast's prime biotech hub in South San Francisco. Earli's scientific advisors include Jim Allison (MD Anderson, Nobel Laureate), Pam Sharma (MD Anderson), Bob Langer (MIT, Moderna), Phil Greenberg (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center), Lee Hartwell (formerly Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Nobel Laureate), Alan Ashworth (UCSF) and Judy Garber (Dana-Farber).

We believe that the transition to a native financial layer on the internet is an important step for humanity. It is free, frictionless and not controlled by anyone. This transition has already started on a small scale for insiders, but cryptocurrencies have failed to reach mass adoption over the last 10 years.

Worldcoin aims to rectify this by creating a new cryptocurrency and distributing it to everyone on earth through a novel approach: a dedicated hardware device ensuring both humanness and uniqueness of everybody signing up, while maintaining their privacy and the overall transparency of a permissionless blockchain. Machine Learning Engineer - Security Team

We are looking for a machine learning engineer to help us ensure fairness and build trust with our users. Worldcoin will deploy a novel IoT device in unsecured environments to solve the ""unique human"" problem that has foiled previous attempts at a ""fair launch."" The device will be able to biometrically verify newcomers to the network under adversarial conditions, while simultaneously preserving privacy in an auditable manner. You will advance the device's state-of-the-art security system, with a heavy focus on machine learning. You will work closely with our device hardware and software teams to design and implement fraud detection algorithms to be iteratively deployed in field tests, as well as attacked by internal and external red teams.
Requirements

Extensive prior work in computer vision research.
Strong foundation in probability and statistics.
Many years of programming experience (e.g. Python, Rust).
Familiarity with sensor fusion, deep learning, and anomaly detection.

ABOUT WORLDCOIN

Worldcoin is co-founded by Sam Altman, Alex Blania and Max Novendstern and funded by Andreessen Horowitz and others. We are looking for mission-driven and high-performing team players, who will help us onboard everyone on earth into a new borderless financial system.
