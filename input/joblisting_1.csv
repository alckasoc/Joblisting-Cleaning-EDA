On the off chance you've thought about insurance, it's likely because you've insured something you love, not because you loved your insurance company. Metromile is out to change that. As an insurtech company powered by data science and customer-centric design, we're building a community of drivers who come for the savings and stay for the experience.

With technology at its core, Metromile is reimagining insurance to make it fairer and actually delightful. We're obsessed with savings, service, and features -- street sweeping alerts, monthly mileage summaries, fuel trackers and more -- that engage a customer all along their journey. We're on the forefront of disrupting a $250 billion auto insurance category that has gone unchanged for over 80 years.

Metromile's diverse team combines the best of Silicon Valley technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial services giants. This management structure ensures that the business is focused on growth, customer experience and technology innovation while also balancing unit economics and profitability. The team is growing quickly across its San Francisco, Tempe, and Boston offices, as well as remotely. Our customer service, claims, and sales teams are all based in-house in the US.

Thanks to what makes us different -- our people and our technology -- we've been honored with a slew of awards. A few recent ones include: named a Benzinga ""Best Insurtech"" finalist, a Top Company to Work For , one of the Healthiest Employers in Phoenix , and a Best Place to Work . And, our CEO was recognized as a 2020 40 under 40 .

About The Role

At a pivotal inflection point of growth, Metromile is seeking a Staff Data Scientist to work with partners from across our company (actuarial, claims, marketing, telematics, and underwriting) to scale an effective business. This role will provide technical leadership in data practices, modeling infrastructure/architecture, and algorithmic design as a core member of a growing team. Your models will have an outsized impact in optimizing the balance between profitability, risk, and growth; enabling dynamic customer experiences; and powering our pricing strategies.

Data is our product; understanding how driver behavior relates to risk is at the core of our insurance business and will disrupt the way the industry currently operates. For one project, you might draw on data from in-car sensors, mobile devices, and connected vehicles to improve how quickly we are able to assess driving risk. For another, you might use the data we collect during the quote-and-enroll sign-up process to streamline the customer experience.

If you are excited by the opportunity to explore diverse data sources and work on impactful projects central to our company's mission, we'd love to hear from you.

PicnicHealth is all about making medical records easy to access and using data to power the next frontier of medical research. We work directly with patients to give them the only tool anywhere that truly provides all of their medical records from any doctor or healthcare system in the US—in an easy-to-use, secure online dashboard. Patients can then choose to contribute their unique data to scientific research, which helps researchers accelerate breakthroughs in care for the diseases they care about. To date we've helped tens of thousands of patients, partnered with some of the world's largest biopharma companies, and raised more than $35M including from Felicis Ventures, Amplify Partners, and Y Combinator. Post Series B, we're growing quickly in revenue, partnerships, and people - it's an exciting time to join the PicnicHealth team!

ML at Picnic

Machine learning is at the heart of our work. While the healthcare industry is waiting for standards and APIs to take hold, we're able to create meaningful medical data today through our process for extracting and structuring medical information from records in whatever format they exist in the real world. We ingest medical records (faxes, scans, etc of printouts from EHRs, electronic data from EHRs) and convert them into structured, labeled medical data. Think of what we do as a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop machine learning system. We 1) run OCR to transform the image into text, 2) identify and label regions of the record, and 3) classify medical concepts with codes from standard ontologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, etc) and structure relevant attributes. Ultimately, structuring data is just the starting point. We'll use machine learning to pull insights from medical data and surface the most relevant information to make better decisions around care.

We've sourced and trained a scalable team of nurses in the Philippines to identify and label data and have already labeled records from more than 25,000 different doctors. We're going through a crazy period of 20x growth this year, coming off our recent Grand Prize finish in Google Cloud's Machine Learning Startup Competition .

Patients can then choose to contribute their unique data to scientific research, which helps researchers accelerate breakthroughs in care for the diseases they care about. To date we've helped tens of thousands of patients, partnered with some of the world's largest biopharma companies, and raised more than $35M including from Felicis Ventures, Amplify Partners, and Y Combinator. Post Series B, we're growing quickly in revenue, partnerships, and people - it's an exciting time to join the PicnicHealth team!

The Opportunity

Machine learning is at the heart of our work extracting and structuring data from medical records in the real world. We ingest records in whatever format they exist -- faxes, scans, printouts, generated from EHRs, handwritten notes, imaging reports, etc. -- and convert them into validated, structured data. Structuring is just the starting point, and enables us to to build products that improve patient/doctor communication and care decisions, or develop the next generation of data-driven life-sciences studies.

Our Machine Learning team's goal is to continually improve the efficiency of our human-in-the-loop pipeline for structuring medical records. To do this, we have an ambitious plan to substantially increase our ML capabilities. We are looking for Applied ML Scientists to help us succeed with this plan.

ML at Picnic

Machine learning is at the heart of our work. While the healthcare industry is waiting for standards and APIs to take hold, we're able to create meaningful medical data today through our process for extracting and structuring medical information from records in whatever format they exist in the real world. We ingest medical records (faxes, scans, etc of printouts from EHRs, electronic data from EHRs) and convert them into structured, labeled medical data. Think of what we do as a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop machine learning system. We 1) run OCR to transform the image into text, 2) identify and label regions of the record, and 3) classify medical concepts with codes from standard ontologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, etc) and structure relevant attributes. Ultimately, structuring data is just the starting point. We'll use machine learning to pull insights from medical data and surface the most relevant information to make better decisions around care.

We've sourced and trained a scalable team of nurses in the Philippines to identify and label data and have already labeled records from more than 25,000 different doctors. We're going through a crazy period of 20x growth this year, coming off our recent Grand Prize finish in Google Cloud's Machine Learning Startup Competition .

Contracts are the atomic unit of business - everything important that a company does involves a contract: sales, purchases, hires, everything.

Instead of using people, we want to use machines to do these things. Here is our reasoning behind this: If we can automate the back office, then we won't have costs associated with customers like traditional banks. We would be able to offer state of the art finance products to everyone at a low cost, regardless of their bank balance.
