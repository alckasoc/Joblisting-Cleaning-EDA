On the off chance you've thought about insurance, it's likely because you've insured something you love, not because you loved your insurance company. Metromile is out to change that. As an insurtech company powered by data science and customer-centric design, we're building a community of drivers who come for the savings and stay for the experience.

With technology at its core, Metromile is reimagining insurance to make it fairer and actually delightful. We're obsessed with savings, service, and features -- street sweeping alerts, monthly mileage summaries, fuel trackers and more -- that engage a customer all along their journey. We're on the forefront of disrupting a $250 billion auto insurance category that has gone unchanged for over 80 years.

Metromile's diverse team combines the best of Silicon Valley technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial services giants. This management structure ensures that the business is focused on growth, customer experience and technology innovation while also balancing unit economics and profitability. The team is growing quickly across its San Francisco, Tempe, and Boston offices, as well as remotely. Our customer service, claims, and sales teams are all based in-house in the US.

Thanks to what makes us different -- our people and our technology -- we've been honored with a slew of awards. A few recent ones include: named a Benzinga ""Best Insurtech"" finalist, a Top Company to Work For , one of the Healthiest Employers in Phoenix , and a Best Place to Work .

About The Role

At a pivotal inflection point of growth, Metromile is seeking a Staff Data Scientist to work with partners from across our company (actuarial, claims, marketing, telematics, and underwriting) to scale an effective business.

Your models will have an outsized impact in optimizing the balance between profitability, risk, and growth; enabling dynamic customer experiences; and powering our pricing strategies.

Data is our product; understanding how driver behavior relates to risk is at the core of our insurance business and will disrupt the way the industry currently operates. For one project, you might draw on data from in-car sensors, mobile devices, and connected vehicles to improve how quickly we are able to assess driving risk. For another, you might use the data we collect during the quote-and-enroll sign-up process to streamline the customer experience.

At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.
We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they’ve managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.
At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.

ABOUT RAPP

Our purpose

We are the agency absolutely, utterly, fiercely focused on the individual. We use our data, technology and creative smarts to make meaningful, connections with every single person a brand knows.

As a guiding ethos, RAPP stands up for Individuality. So much as, that's in our agency value proposition. We're committed to racial justice, equality, representation, and unbiased economic opportunity, because we know that the strength of our diversity helps us create our best work. And we believe in harnessing the strength of all our Fiercely Individual people, and the differences among us, because that's the surest way to positively impact our business and network culture.



We are a member of Omnicom's Precision Marketing Group (OPMG) focused on digital and CRM marketing.



If we learned anything this year, it's that our organization truly can implement a ""work where you work best"" philosophy. We still have physical offices, and, if they're open, you are welcome to use them whenever you like. RAPP is located right near Chinatown in the financial district of San Francisco, we're used to trollies (and tourists) daily.

No pressure, though - if you aren't comfortable with coming in while COVID-19 plays out, you can still work where you work best. That said, while we do have our ""work where you work best"" philosophy, we legally have to care about what state you claim permanent residency in (it's a tax thing).



From opening a checking account, helping to reduce peanut allergies, or diving into the creative tools that help engineers most, we provide smart solutions for Wells Fargo, Aimmune Therapeutics and Palo Alto Networks.



You have 2-3 years of experience in a data science or data engineering role. A master's degree is preferred but not required. You have a strong knowledge of R/Python programming and database technologies like SQL/Redshift and ideally have some exposure to tools like Apache Spark and AWS Sagemaker.

We are thinking a lot about media mix modelling and multi-touch attribution these days but any experience you have integrating disparate data sets and applying machine learning algorithms to surface insights around consumer behavior or to create more precise and personalized marketing campaigns will get our attention.

We have been operating as ""mostly remote"" during the pandemic. As we transition back to the office, we are introducing our Workplace Flexibility Model. Most roles will be based out of our Sunnyvale office and balance in-office time with flexibility to support other needs you have in your life. This flexibility could be used to reduce the Bay Area commute burden by working from home a couple days a week, support parent or caregiver needs, or allow space for you to do the other things you love, whatever that might be! There are times when achieving great work is more productive when working where you work best. That's the point of this model...flexibility for you. A few roles will be approved as fully remote. Those are determined by managers and approved by our senior team.

We anticipate following this flexibility model starting mid-July 2021 as we continue to follow local guidelines and protocol around COVID."

At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.

We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they've managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.

Instead of hiring hundreds of people to manually review, you’re adding new data points to ensure accurate scoring. You’re hands-on, creative, and hyper-analytical. You understand that the ultimate measurement of success is enabling patients to afford care in a time of need, with a fair rate, in terms they understand. At the end of the day, you want to change the way credit is evaluated."

Machine learning is at the heart of our work. While the healthcare industry is waiting for standards and APIs to take hold, we're able to create meaningful medical data today through our process for extracting and structuring medical information from records in whatever format they exist in the real world. We ingest medical records (faxes, scans, etc of printouts from EHRs, electronic data from EHRs) and convert them into structured, labeled medical data. Think of what we do as a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop machine learning system. We 1) run OCR to transform the image into text, 2) identify and label regions of the record, and 3) classify medical concepts with codes from standard ontologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, etc) and structure relevant attributes. Ultimately, structuring data is just the starting point. We'll use machine learning to pull insights from medical data and surface the most relevant information to make better decisions around care.

The Planner Evaluation team is working on one of the most challenging problems in autonomous driving: building algorithms to assess the safety and quality of our autonomous vehicles at scale. Evaluation at scale is of paramount importance in solving autonomous driving: the algorithms we build orient the development of planner software by defining the north star and thus enabling rapid iteration. Almost every improvement to Waymo's planner is influenced by our work, indirectly (by providing the quality signals for onboard engineers to aim for) or directly (by incorporating our algorithms into our onboard motion planning code). This is no easy feat. As our self-driving car gets better and accumulates more miles, we need rigorous and intelligent methods to automatically assess whether a scene is risky, a maneuver causes discomfort, or an interaction with pedestrians or other drivers could be managed better. This can be done through geometric reasoning, simulation, machine learning, and/or modeling with statistical distributions. Developing evaluation algorithms in autonomous driving is an uncharted space and thus requires true ingenuity.

Since our start as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo has been focused on building the World's Most Experienced Driver in hopes of improving the world's access to mobility while saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. Our Waymo Driver powers Waymo One, our fully autonomous ride-hailing service, as well as Waymo Via, our trucking and local delivery service. To date, Waymo has driven over 20 million miles autonomously on public roads across 25 U.S. cities and conducted over 20 billion miles of simulation testing.

Software Engineering builds the brains of Waymo's fully autonomous driving technology. Our software allows the Waymo Driver to perceive the world around it make the right decision for every situation, and deliver people safely to their destinations. We think deeply and solve complex technical challenges in areas like robotics, perception, decision-making and deep learning, while collaborating with hardware and systems engineers. If you're a software engineer or researcher who's curious and passionate about Level 4 autonomous driving, we'd like to meet you.

The Planner Evaluation team is working on one of the most challenging problems in autonomous driving: building algorithms to assess the safety and quality of our autonomous vehicles at scale. Evaluation at scale is of paramount importance in solving autonomous driving: the algorithms we build orient the development of planner software by defining the north star and thus enabling rapid iteration. Almost every improvement to Waymo's planner is influenced by our work, indirectly (by providing the quality signals for onboard engineers to aim for) or directly (by incorporating our algorithms into our onboard motion planning code). This is no easy feat. As our self-driving car gets better and accumulates more miles, we need rigorous and intelligent methods to automatically assess whether a scene is risky, a maneuver causes discomfort, or an interaction with pedestrians or other drivers could be managed better. This can be done through geometric reasoning, simulation, machine learning, and/or modeling with statistical distributions. Developing evaluation algorithms in autonomous driving is an uncharted space and thus requires true ingenuity. If you are excited about leveraging a large volume of extremely rich data in an area with lots of unexplored territory to help the advent of autonomous driving technology, this is the place for you!

About The I School

UC Berkeley's newest school, the School of Information (I School), was created in 1994 to address one of society's most compelling challenges: the need to organize and make sense of the abundance of information that we can now collect, store, and share without regard for cost or distance. The way we organize, represent, govern, and make sense of this information will shape our ability to achieve public as well as private goals.

The I School educates professionals and scholars to understand the problems and possibilities of information, to develop models of information practice, and to design useful and usable information applications, services, and solutions. This requires insights from diverse fields. Our faculty includes scholars and professionals with deep expertise in information and computer science, social sciences, management, law, design, and policy, as well as related fields.

The I School offers three professional master's degrees and an academic doctoral degree. Our MIMS program trains students for careers as information professionals and emphasizes small classes and project-based learning. Our MIDS program trains data scientists to manage and analyze the coming onslaught of big data, in a unique high-touch online degree. Our MICS program prepares cybersecurity leaders with the technical skills and contextual knowledge necessary to develop solutions for complex cybersecurity challenges. Our Ph.D. program equips scholars to develop solutions and shape policies that influence how people seek, use, and share information.

Our students and graduates work at well-known Bay Area companies that include Apple, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Twitter, and LinkedIn, as well as at nonprofits like Kaiser Permanente and established businesses like Wells Fargo and Chevron. Many of our graduates take advantage of the opportunity to get in on the ground floor to create or work for start-ups.

We make software that anyone can mold and shape to take on every challenge — from taking personal notes to running large companies. We've been building together since 2016 and are trusted by customers including Nike, Airbnb, Slack, Samsung, and more. We're excited to be growing a team as diverse and creative as the millions of people we reach worldwide, and a company where everyone can thrive.

About The Role:
Do you want to help define what data means at Notion? We are looking to hire engineers with a vision for what our data tooling and infrastructure should look like as we scale, and then to build and operate those systems over time.

You'll partner with teams all around the company to empower every function with data and insights. You'll help evolve Notion and the infrastructure it uses to make sure that decisions can always be driven by high quality data.


You'll design and set up the foundations that enable everyone in the company - data scientists, finance, customer success, etc. - to effectively leverage data. This can involve data pipelines, model serving, dashboards, and many other things!

You'll articulate best practices around logging and ingestion frameworks and implement the changes to make those practices a reality.

You'll implement monitoring and alerting and systems to guarantee data quality and consistency.

You'll determine the best ways to handle Notion's unique data model and usage patterns to derive insights and bring intelligence to product features like search and discovery.

You'll create tools to enable the data science team to produce insights quickly, and help them apply and generalize statistical and econometric models efficiently across large datasets.


For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You have worked cross-functionally to establish the right overarching data architecture for a company's needs, to build data pipelines, and to provide guidance on best data practices for the business.

You have managed data pipelines (e.g. Spark, Flink), data lakes or warehouses (e.g. Snowflake, Hive), authored queries (SQL), used workflow management (e.g. Airflow, Luigi), and have experience maintaining the infra that supports these.

For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.

You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.

You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.

To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.

You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you are explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.


You've built out data infrastructure from, or nearly from, scratch at a fast-growing startup.

You've led or managed a Data Engineering / Platform / Infrastructure Team.

About The Role:
Do you want to help define what data means at Notion? We are looking to hire engineers with a vision for what our data tooling and infrastructure should look like as we scale, and then to build and operate those systems over time.

You'll partner with teams all around the company to empower every function with data and insights. You'll help evolve Notion and the infrastructure it uses to make sure that decisions can always be driven by high quality data.


You'll design and set up the foundations that enable everyone in the company - data scientists, finance, customer success, etc. - to effectively leverage data. This can involve data pipelines, model serving, dashboards, and many other things!

You'll articulate best practices around logging and ingestion frameworks and implement the changes to make those practices a reality.

You'll implement monitoring and alerting and systems to guarantee data quality and consistency.

You'll determine the best ways to handle Notion's unique data model and usage patterns to derive insights and bring intelligence to product features like search and discovery.

You'll create tools to enable the data science team to produce insights quickly, and help them apply and generalize statistical and econometric models efficiently across large datasets.


For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You have worked cross-functionally to establish the right overarching data architecture for a company's needs, to build data pipelines, and to provide guidance on best data practices for the business.

You have managed data pipelines (e.g. Spark, Flink), data lakes or warehouses (e.g. Snowflake, Hive), authored queries (SQL), used workflow management (e.g. Airflow, Luigi), and have experience maintaining the infra that supports these.

For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.

You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.

You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.

To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.

You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you are explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.


You've built out data infrastructure from, or nearly from, scratch at a fast-growing startup.

You've led or managed a Data Engineering / Platform / Infrastructure Team.

You've owned or managed mission-critical datasets."
