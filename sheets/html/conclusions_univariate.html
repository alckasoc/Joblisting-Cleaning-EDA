just<br>one joblisting making it difficult to use for machine learning.<br>I could try different methods of sampling, but I&#39;ll hold off on this for now.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">You can see from this word cloud that the data science position varies a lot! It really depends on the joblisting. Some can be data analysts, machine learning engineers, quantitative analysts, data engineers, etc.</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">There are no NaNs and no -1s, however, though the headquarters unique values<br>are mostly fine, there seem to be a lot of mix in with what seems to be &quot;job title&quot;.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Min salary is 37k and the max is 209k. The average salary estimate for data scientists on <span style="text-decoration:underline;-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;color:#1155cc;"><a target="_blank" href="http://glassdoor.com/">Glassdoor.com</a></span> is around 133k to 135k.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">There is no surprise here that most joblistings are looking<br>for full-time workers. But my curiosity is nagging me:<br>Glassdoor.com is more catered to job seekers and not<br>students who are looking for internships or people looking for a<br>temporary contract. This can reflect the demographics of people who visit<br>Glassdoor.com to be mostly college graduates or people with job experience<br>looking to commit to a full-time job.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">It seems if the &quot;10000+ employees&quot; were removed,<br>then it would be a pretty uniform distribution.<br>However, it seems that most companies with 10000+ employees<br>post on Glassdoor.com. This could support the conclusion that<br>Glassdoor.com&#39;s demographics mainly consist of actual job seekers as<br>these larger companies are looking for employees (which most likely<br>means these positions aren&#39;t temporary).</td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Most joblistings are understandable:<br>they are from companies, whether they are<br>public or private.</td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Unsurprisingly, most joblistings on Glassdoor.com are from large tech companies<br>who specialize in information technology or something tech/business related.<br>In fact, half my entire dataset consists of joblistings from companies in the<br>information technology sector.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Weirdly enough, most companies don&#39;t provide revenues.<br>Those companies that do provide a revenue, it is usually $10+ billion.<br>Assuming my dataset is representative of the joblistings on Glassdoor.com,<br>it seems that larger companies (companies producing larger revenue) tend to post more.<br>However, this is true if we ignore the &quot;unknown / non-applicable&quot;.<br>Since there are many companies posting &lt;10 joblistings, there could be a<br>relationship between the scarcity of joblistings from a certain company and the<br>decision for that company to post or not post the revenue.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Nothing out of the ordinary! They look for job experience, product and mission centric minds, great with teams and communication and familiar with machine learning!</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">The average rating is 4.1 while the minimum is 2.1 and the max is 5.0. The median and mean are close meaning this distribution is pretty normal.</td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s4" dir="ltr">Cleaning</td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1764509357R2" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">3</div></th><td class="s1" dir="ltr">Company has no missing values.<br>They also have no outliers.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Facebook/Meta is, in fact, not hiring for the same role. However, they seem to be hiring a TON of data analytics and also a suite of data scientists geared towards marketing and maintaining guidelines. In retrospect, we understand this huge influx in hiring is due to their Metaverse project. Our question 9 explores it a little further in exploring how their hiring plans to tackle this project. That is, they have seriously put a lot of effort into ensuring this new product will entice consumers. I notice they hire for &quot;Emerging business&quot;. What an odd title! I&#39;ve never seen these in job boards. Perhaps they were uncertain how this new AR/VR sector would turn out.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Clearly, most of the joblistings have headquarters in San Francisco, CA. And the top headquarter locations are all in Silicon Valley. <br>It makes sense as this place has traditionally been understood as a tech hotspot for large companies and tech startups. <br>Also, these are all located in CA.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Clearly looks like there is a huge gap from 106k to 157k. This is obvious as most <br>joblistings ask for general data scientists who either aren&#39;t seniors or aren&#39;t juniors. <br>And those data scientists are generally paid around 135k. And thus, you won&#39;t see single <br>occurrences of joblistings around that center. These joblistings are probably looking for specialized <br>or beginners who aren&#39;t as experienced as a data scientist with 2 years of job experience.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">This is interesting. We searched for data science jobs, but we got a few part-time, contract, and<br>internship positions. This is due to Glassdoor&#39;s minute imprecision in job searching.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Of course, Silicon Valley is dominated by large tech companies, employing tens of thousands of workers.<br>What surprised me here is how (near) uniform the rest of the graph was. It&#39;s a strong trend that companies<br>regardless of size tend to leverage social joblisting platforms for recruitment. Probably even as their primary<br>source of talent acquisition!</td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Expectedly, private and public companies leverage data scientists the most.<br>However, these 2 categories branch over many different sectors. The &quot;type&quot; column<br>seems like a rough estimate of what sector the joblisting entails. Interestingly,<br>schools and universities hire data scientists!</td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">&quot;Sector&quot; overlaps with &quot;type&quot;. It gives more insight into the actual industry/sector the role<br>is suited for. There are a lot more unique categories! I know data scientists have domains in which they work in, but I had no idea there were this many industries: education, transportation, oil &amp; gas, etc! Information technology, as expected, trumps all other sectors. However, it is also interesting to see the runner up, biotech &amp; pharma, is actually above business services and finance. Why is this demand so high?</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Generally, the smaller the company, the less joblistings they can afford to post.<br>Larger companies pool lots of their applications into Glassdoor (and LinkedIn, Indeed, etc). Interestingly, a lot of companies didn&#39;t list their revenue. This &quot;null&quot; category can encompass anything from the non-profit organization to simply a volunteer bias.</td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Most ratings land in the 3.5 to 4.5 range. There are more higher ratings than there are lower ratings. There is no absolute zero (e.g. rating is 0). There is a stagger: most joblistings don&#39;t have a 3.9 or a 4.2, or 4.5+. And very few companies have low ratings. </td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s5" dir="ltr">EDA</td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1764509357R3" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">4</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">144 companies (out of 443) just have 1 joblisting and 412 unique companies out of 443 companies have less than 10 <br>joblistings posted out of the Glassdoor.com joblistings I sampled. Additionally, it seems that Facebook, by far, has <br>the most job offerings for data scientists (as of now, I don&#39;t know why).</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">If I&#39;m not wrong, then my googling tells me Ursus is a staffing firm for matching candidates to jobs. They provide recruiting solutions for other companies to select potential candidates. Interesting. Matter of fact, I could imagine data scientists in these types of positions would focus on something similar to what this project is about! Analyzing and extracting findings from data on the job market and candidates.<br>From http://fastestgrowing.staffingindustry.com/listing/ursus-2021/, they seem to have huge success! The growth rate is amazing! I can understand that companies with huge growth can afford to onboard more talent.</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Unsurprisingly, lots of jobs are located in San Francisco. And those that aren&#39;t are<br>within Silicon Valley. Interesting that South San Francisco is much lower than San Francisco.<br>What factors could lead to such a low representation?</td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Seems like as the salary estimate increases to a decent bit past the<br>center, the higher the chance it is to see more unique salary estimates.<br>Same thing can be said for decreasing the salary estimate. </td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s3"></td><td class="s2" dir="ltr">This distribution plot supports the conclusion I made earlier about the ratings.<br>There is also a gap in 3.9 and 4.2.

And about less than 25 unique companies<br>post 10-20 joblistings. So while Facebook posted by far the most joblistings on Glassdoor.com,<br>the majority of joblistings on Glassdoor.com (assuming my dataset is representative of all joblistings<br>on Glassdoor.com) are from other companies.
